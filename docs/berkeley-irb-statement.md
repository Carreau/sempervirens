Hi Nathaniel,

Thank you for your email.  I think you are on the right track!  I will
provide my answers in bold below.  Please let me know if you have any
questions.  Thanks, Alexis

\*\*CORRECT - As discussed, your team will not be engaged in
"research" as defined below.  Also, as discussed, it sounds really
important to not collect any identifying data.

**"Research** means a *systematic investigation*, including research
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute
to *generalizable knowledge*.

*Systematic investigation* means a study or examination involving a
methodical procedure or plan.

*Generalizable knowledge* means conclusions, facts, or principles
derived from particulars (individual subjects, medical records, etc.)
that are applicable to or affect a whole category (members of a class,
kind, or group, a field of knowledge, etc.) and enhance scientific or
academic understanding.

*Design* refers to the purpose of the investigation. Some investigations
are exploratory or are intended to train students and are not designed
to produce generalizable knowledge. It is important to note that
although some projects involving qualitative data collection or
projects that are exploratory in nature may not have specific aims and
hypotheses at the outset of the research, these are still *systematic
investigations designed to contribute to generalizable knowledge* if
the purpose of the project is to archive results for future research,
compare results to other assessments, or draw conclusions."

Yes, this all sounds correct.  Just keep in mind that you mention that
the existing data will be anonymous.  If so, then it will not meet the
definition of human subject and will not require local IRB
review. However, it is always a good idea for researchers to contact
their local IRB, if they have any questions about whether or not IRB
review is needed.
